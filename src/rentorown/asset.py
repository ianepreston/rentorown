    It seems like a common method in financial modelling to just take the monthly
    standard deviation and multiply it by sqrt(12) to annualize it. So in reverse that
    would just be the formula below. I haven't looked into what assumptions have to
    hold for this to be valid and I'm planning to be a bit more careful with how I
    parameterise things. But as a first approximation it's a decent helper

    Notes
    -----
    Right now this does not assume any tax on capital gains on the portfolio. You can
    hack around that by inputing a tax adjusted expected return. Ideally it would have
    some way of knowing your current and future TFSA and RRSP contribution room and
    applying appropriate taxes on deposits above and beyond that amount, but it doesn't
    yet.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist: Callable, default np.random.normal
        The distribution from which returns are drawn
    dist_args : dict
        dictionary of kwargs to be passed along with dist defaults to
        mean 0.006, standard deviation 0.06
    periods: int, default 300
        Number of periods to simulate
    simulations: int, default 100
        Number of simulations to run

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        periods x simulations array of cumulative returns for the asset
        I think of it as the price of a security (with no dividends etc)
        normalized to = 1 in the first period. You can then take a series of
        cash flows to compute the number of shares in that asset you can buy
        in a given period, cumulatively sum those shares, and then multiply them by
        the asset price for any period to determine total wealth accumulated
