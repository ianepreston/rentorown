    "With that said, here's the general idea of how to use this notebook. If you've never used a Jupyter notebook (this thing) before and want to read more about it, [this guide](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) is a decent place to start. The TLDR for just running a simulation is that each of these grey blocks is a chunk of code. If you run them in order, updating the prompts that they provide as you go, you'll get to a \"run simulation\" button, which will output the results of simulating the financial outcome of renting or owning under the conditions that you specify. Each of the grey blocks (or cells) can be run by either selecting them and pressing ctrl+enter or clicking the play icon in the top bar. Don't forget to adjust the settings below each box before you run the simulation."

It will then run 1,000 simulations of renting and owning under the scenario you have described above. Once those are complete it will plot a histogram of the distribution of the value of your asset (a house or investments) at the end of your mortgage amortization, as well as the median of those values over the investment horizon. Finally it will show a table of your mortgage payments over the amortization period if you were to buy a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few remaining factors that can be tweaked here before you run the simulation. I haven't created sliders for them, but you can just modify the cell below directly if you'd like. I'll outline what those options are below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lines you'd want to modify to change the scenario start after the ```mtg = RentOrOwn``` line in the cell below. The first 5 lines below that are fully controlled by the sliders above. You can hard code numbers in there if you'd like, but in those cases it's probably easier to use the sliders. The next to lines refer to the assumptions about the distribution of housing and investment assets. As long as you're ok with the assumption of normally distributed returns you can just use the sliders above. If you want to use a different distribution you can modify those two lines. You can refer to the [numpy docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html) for details on specifying other distributions, a detailed guide is beyond the scope of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond those lines, there are a few smaller assumptions that you can modify. They are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```number_of_simulations``` How many times to simulate each scenario. The default is 1_000, which seems to be a decent tradeoff between getting a good sampling of possible outcomes with not making the simulation take too long. If you are running this on a nice beefy machine feel free to crank this up, and if you're running it somewhere less powerful and it's taking too long, try scaling it down\n",
    "* ```additional_purchase_costs``` This is meant to cover things like legal fees, title insurance, home inspection, home appraisal, etc. If you leave it set to ```None``` it defaults to 2,300, which I estimated to be a reasonable amount when I wrote this code. If you know better for your particular situation and time feel free to update.\n",
    "* ```additional_monthly_costs``` Any additional costs of ownership beyond a mortgage and property tax (e.g condo fees, or utilities that would be included in your rent)\n",
    "* ```mortgage_payment_schedule``` how frequently you will make mortgage payments. The default is \"monthly\", but you can change it to any of \"monthly\", \"bi_weekly\" or \"acc_bi_weekly\" (which stands for accelerated bi-weekly.\n",
    "* ```annual_inflation``` The annual rate at which rent and non-mortgage ownership costs will grow. I assume 2% by default based on the Bank of Canada's long run target.\n",
    "* ```monthly_property_tax_rate``` this is the percentage of the initial home value that will be charged. If default will take a number that I pulled from the City of Edmonton calculator at time of writing. Note that this is escalated by inflation, not against the forecasted value of the home, since I make the assumption that cities are trying to pull in a fixed real level of earnings from residential real estate, and will move their rates up or down to adjust to changing real estate prices. Maybe that's not the right assumption, see what I mean about this being tricky?\n",
    "* ```maintenance_cost``` This is the annual percentage of the starting value of the house that will have to go towards maintenance that you wouldn't incurr in the case of renting. It is also escalated by inflation. It defaults to 1%, but you may need to  modify it, especially in the case of an older house.\n"
